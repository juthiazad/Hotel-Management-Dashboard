# Hotel-Management-Dashboard

This Hotel Management Dashboard tracks bookings, guests, revenue, cancellations, and revenue losses.It highlights monthly revenue trends, cancellation ratios by lead time and channel, and top countries by revenue.The dashboard also shows booking distribution across channels and identifies major sources of revenue loss. I've uncovered through an interactive dashboard created with Excel.

Key Highlights :

1.Total Revenue: $29.6M with $13.1M loss due to 44.2K cancellations (37% rate).

2.Online Travel Agents dominate bookings (62%) but also drive the highest revenue loss ($10.8M).

3.Portugal, UK, and France are the top revenue contributors, while last-minute cancellations cause nearly 46% losses.
